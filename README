As you can probably see from the source code, I made extensive use of UTF-8
symbols for variable names. But I don't know of any compiler that handles them,
so I've had to write a script to automatically change the names of the
variables. These could theoretically conflict, but in practice, I don't use
names like "Qprime" ever, so it has not been a problem.
